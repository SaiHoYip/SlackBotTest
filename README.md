# SlackBotTest
Playing around with the slack api for learning purposes and getting people to contribute

Reason for this Project:
  Bots are very versatile and they are only as useful as the programmer makes them! You can do almost anything with a bot as long as you code them to do so. Wanted a project that I can use to incorporate what I learned plus get everyone involved no matter the experience level!
