Jenkins is a really useful CI tool where you can define a workflow of build, test, and deploy. 
Before you release your code you might want to test it which is where jenkins comes in.

<p>
Build: Usually the start of the stage where your code goes through it to make sure the code works before going on to the next stage. 
</p>
<p>
Test: The stage where you put the code through a series of tests.
</p>
<p>
Deploy: The stage where you allow the code to be deployed once all the other stages have been successful.
